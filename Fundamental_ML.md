Here is the fundamental of machine learning concept. Every ML enthusiast must know these topics thoroughly:
1. Definition of ML
2. Need of ML
3. Types of Ml
4. Batch and online learning
5. Overfitting and underfitting

<strong>1.Definition </strong>
Machine learning is the science of programming computers to learn from data.

[Machine Learning is the] field of study that gives computers the ability to learn
without being explicitly programmed.
â€”Arthur Samuel, 1959

<strong>2.Need of machine learning </strong><br>

1. Problems for which existing solutions require a lot of hand-tuning 
2. The best Machine Learning techniques can find a solution that traditional method cannot.
3. Machine Learning systems can adapt to new data.

<strong>3. Types of ML</strong><br>
1. Supervised Learning: Here algorithm requires all attention There are basically two important types of supervied learning <br>
a)regression and b)classification <br>
Example: spam Email classification
supervised learning algorithms
1. logistic regression
2. Linear regression
3.  KNN
4.  SVM
5.  Decision tree and random forest 

2. Unsupervised Learning
   Unsupervised Learning is learning with data without a teacher there are 3 types of Unsupervised Learning algorithm
   a) clustering
   b)Visualization and dimensionality reduction
   c)Association rule learning
   example: when there is a blog website then using  Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) we can find out the similar visitor
   It can also detect which types of blog visitors at what time and which category

 3. Reinforcement Learning
    You build a model and perform an action then give a penalty or reward according to the action
    eg: many robots are learned using reinforcement learning to walk

<strong>4. Batch learning and online learning </strong>
in batch learning, data is feed and launched to production and further no data is feed whereas online learning data is feed at the time of production 
note:1. Online learning is actually done offline
2.80% of data is given to training and the remaining 20% to testing model

<strong>5. overfitting and underfitting </strong>
When the model performs well on training data but not in generalized data overfitting occurs
whereas the underfitting model is too simple 
example: when we face bad behavior of taxi driver in country we assume all country bad taxi driver same mistake machine fall into same trap
