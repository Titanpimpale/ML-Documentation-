Today I learned the Decision Tree:

Decision are used in classification and regression (primarily used in classification)

Basically, we give data to the algorithm if the model is in a tree structure then the model is called a decision.

Decision  node :

when root nodes classify the data they split into yes or no branches they are called decision node 

Leaf node:

leaf node is the final value of the classification model
