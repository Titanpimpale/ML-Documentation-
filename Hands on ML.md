In this documentation we will tackle real-life problems using machine learning:
1. Frame question
2. Get data
3. Visualize your data
4. Prepare your data for ml algorithm
5. Train your model
6. Lauch

Now let's begin,
1. Frame Question: Ask questions such as What is the use of machine learning? what benefits will you get after using machine learning?
   Main question you should ask is what exactly is objective? How does the company expect to use this model?
   The next question you should ask is what is the current solution for this problem?
   with all these questions you can start your design model  you need to frame the problem: is it supervised, unsupervised,
   or Reinforcement Learning? Is it a classification task, a regression task, or something else?

2. Get data: In Real-world a company or entity provides you a data but students or learners can data on the internet there is huge
   amount of data on the internet following are some resources
 • Popular open data repositories:
 -UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository
 — Kaggle datasets
 — Amazon’s AWS datasets
 • Meta portals (they list open data repositories):
 — http://dataportals.org 
 — http://opendatamonitor.eu 
 — http://quandl.com 
 • Other pages listing many popular open data repositories:
 — Wikipedia’s list of Machine Learning datasets
 — Quora.com question
 — Datasets subreddit
