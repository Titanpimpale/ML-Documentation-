In this documentation we will tackle real life problem using machine learning:
1. Frame question
2. Get data
3. Visualize your data
4. Prepare your data for ml algorithm
5. Train your model
6. Lauch

NOW let's begin,
1. Frame Question: Ask question such as what is use of machine learning? what benefits will get after using machine learning?
   Main question you should ask is what exactly is objective?How does the company expect to use this model?
   Next question you should ask is what is current solution for this problem?
   with all these question now you can start your design model  you need to frame the problem: is it supervised, unsupervised,
   or Reinforcement Learning? Is it a classification task, a regression task, or something else?

2. Get data : In Real world company or entity provides you a data but for student or learner can data for internet there is huge
   amout of data on internet following are some resources
