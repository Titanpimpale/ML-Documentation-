What's guys!!!
today I learned how the human being brain work, why recent boom in neural network?

Neural Network was built to mimic the human brain to perform complex problems.

How the human brain works:

Information is transmitted from one neuron to another another similar neuron transmits information from one neuron layer to multiple layer and finally to output layer

specialty of NN is that they build their own features <br>
For example if you want to build a model that recognizes face then the model identifies the first small part of the face in 1st hidden layer, in the second layer model identifies the ear nose eyebrows eyes mouth, and in finally recognizes that face is of XYZ person
